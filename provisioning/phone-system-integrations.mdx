---

For businesses with existing PBX or VOIP infrastructure, myCalls.ro can integrate through SIP trunks or direct connections:

## 1. SIP Trunk

- **How It Works**: You share your SIP credentials (server, username, password). myCalls.ro configures a trunk internally.
- **Inbound/Outbound**: AI can pick up inbound calls from your PBX or place outbound calls using your existing number ranges.

## 2. Caller ID Forwarding

- If your PBX already handles call routing, pass the call to myCalls.ro only when certain conditions are met (like after IVR selection).

## 3. Hybrid Model

- Some advanced setups keep human agents on your PBX but leverage the AI for high-volume or after-hours calls.
- Example: _During business hours, normal agents handle calls. After hours, calls route to the AI assistant via SIP trunk._

## 4. Things to Note

- SIP sometimes requires opening firewall ports or whitelisting IPs.
- Carrier charges from your PBX provider still apply, plus any myCalls.ro usage fees.
