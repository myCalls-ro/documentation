<Frame>
 <img

<Update label="v1.4.8" description="Aug 14 2025">

### 🧠 Campaigns just got smarter

We’ve added powerful new controls to help you get more out of your outbound campaigns, avoid wasted calls, and make sure every lead gets the attention it deserves.

Here’s what’s new:

### **1. Campaign Call Status Options**
You now have **three new controls** at the campaign level to fine-tune how your leads are called:

- **Retry until goal completed** *Continue calling until the goal is achieved.* Perfect for situations where a lead answers but doesn’t complete the desired action (e.g., no appointment booked). Calls will continue until the selected **goal variable** is marked as true.
- **Retry on voicemail** *Continue calling until a human answers (skip voicemails).* If a call hits voicemail, the lead won’t be marked as completed — the system will retry until someone picks up.
- **Goal variable** *Variable that must be true to mark lead as completed.* Select from your variables which one determines a “completed” lead. If the variable is false, the lead will be retried instead of being marked as completed.

### **2. Update Lead Data/Status from Automation Platform or API**
You can now **update lead details and statuses directly from your connected automation tools or API calls**.

- Change lead status (e.g., “created” instead of “completed”) dynamically.
- Push updated information into your campaigns without manual edits.

### **3. Ringing Timeout in Assistant Settings**
A new **ringing timeout** option in the Assistant settings lets you control how long to wait for an answer before moving on.

- For outbound campaigns, set it **lower** to avoid voicemail and save agent time.
- For campaigns with slower-answering customers, increase it to give them more time to pick up.
