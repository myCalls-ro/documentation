1. **Navigate to Automation Platform**
2. **Create a new flow** from scratch
3. **Search for your calling platform** in the trigger section
4. **Select "Phone Call Ended"** trigger
   - This trigger activates when any call to your selected assistant completes

## Step 2: Configure Assistant and Webhook

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/03-select-assistant.mp4"></video>

1. **Select the assistant** you want to automate
   - Each assistant can only have one "phone call ended" automation
   - All calls to this assistant will go through this automation
2. **Click "Test Trigger"** to generate the webhook
   - This creates a webhook URL in the background
   - The webhook is automatically saved to your assistant settings

## Step 3: Verify Webhook Configuration

<video

  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/05-check-assistant-webhook.mp4"></video>

1. **Open a new tab** and navigate to your assistant
2. **Go to the third tab** "Post-call Actions"
3. **Verify the webhook URL** was automatically added

</Frame>

4. **Review webhook settings:**
   - **Enabled**: Webhook will trigger after calls
   - **Completed calls only**: Only successful calls trigger automation
   - **All calls**: Change to "No" if you want all calls (including failed) to trigger

<Frame>
  <img src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/07-post-call-variables.png" alt="Post-call variables configuration" />
</Frame>

5. **Review post-call variables:**
   - **status**: Boolean (true/false) indicating if call objective was achieved
   - **summary**: Text summary of the call conversation
   - These variables are extracted by AI after each call

## Step 4: Generate Test Call Data

To configure our automation properly, we need actual call data to work with. We'll make a test call to generate the post-call variables.

<Frame>
  <img src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/08-set-test-values.png" alt="Setting test values for call variables" />
</Frame>

1. **Set real values** in your assistant's call variables:
   - **Set your name and email** for realistic test data
   - These will be the default values when testing from the assistant

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/09-make-test-call.mp4"></video>

2. **Make a test call to generate webhook data:**
   - Click **"Speak to Assistant"** → **"Phone Call"**
   - **Answer when your assistant calls you**
   - **Respond positively** to ensure the `status` variable becomes `true`
   - **Complete the call objective** during the conversation
   - **End the call naturally**

<Note>
In a real situation, the assistant will take data assigned to the lead. For testing, it uses the default values you just set.
</Note>

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/10-check-call-results.mp4"></video>

3. **Verify call results and variable extraction:**
   - **Navigate to your calls list** and find the recent call
   - **Click on the call** to view details
   - **Confirm the `status` variable is `true`** (call objective achieved)
   - **Review the extracted `summary`** - this contains AI-generated call summary
   - These variables are extracted after each call based on:
     - Call transcript
     - Variable descriptions
     - Variable types (Boolean for status)
     - System prompt context

<Note>
The variables after a call are being extracted. You can refresh the page after about a minute and then you will see the extracted variables.
</Note>

## Step 5: Configure Automation with Call Data

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/11-received-call-data.mp4"></video>

1. **Return to your automation tab**
2. **Verify you received call data** from the test trigger
   - You should see the webhook data because you clicked "Test Trigger" and then made a call
   - The automation received the request after the call ended and variables were extracted

3. **Alternative method - resend webhook data from existing calls:**

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/12-resend-webhook.mp4"></video>

   - If you need to test with different call data, you can reuse any existing call
   - **Click "Test Trigger"** again in your automation
   - **Go to any completed call** in your platform  
   - **Click "Resend Webhook"** to push that call's data to your automation
   - **Return to automation tab** to see the updated data

### Adding New Post-Call Variables

<Note>
If you need to add a new post-call variable after creating the automation, follow this process to update your automation with the new variable data.
</Note>

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/add-variable.mp4"></video>

1. **Define the new variable in your assistant:**
   - Go to assistant settings → "Post-call Actions" tab
   - Add your new post-call variable (name, type, description)
   - **Save the assistant**

2. **Update automation with new variable data:**
   - **Return to your automation**
   - **Click "Test Trigger"** to prepare for new webhook data


3. **Re-evaluate an existing call:**

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/re-evaluate.mp4"></video>

   - **Go to any completed call** for this assistant
   - **Click "Re-evaluate"** to extract the new variable from that call
   - **Wait for processing** to complete

4. **Send updated data to automation:**
   - **Click "Resend Webhook"** on the same call
   - **Return to automation tab** 
   - **Verify the new variable** is now available in your automation data

<Tip>
This resend feature is useful for testing different scenarios without making new calls every time.
</Tip>

## Step 6: Add Conditional Logic for Qualified Leads

We only want to add leads to Google Sheets when the call objective was achieved.

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/13-add-branch.mp4"></video>

1. **Click the "+" sign** to add a step
2. **Search for "Branch"** in control flow
3. **Select Branch** to create conditional logic

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/14-configure-status-condition.mp4"></video>

4. **Configure the branch condition:**
   - **Select `status` variable** from call data
   - **Choose "Boolean is true"**
   - This creates two paths: True (qualified) and False (not qualified)

## Step 7: Create Google Sheets Integration

Now we'll set up the Google Sheets action for qualified leads (True branch).

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/15-add-google-sheets-action.mp4"></video>

1. **On the True branch**, click the "+" sign
2. **Search for "Google Sheets"**
3. **Select "Insert Row"** action

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/16-create-sheets-connection.mp4"></video>

4. **Create a new Google Sheets connection:**
   - Authorize with your Google account
   - Save the connection for future use

## Step 8: Set Up Your Qualified Leads Spreadsheet

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/18-spreadsheet-headers.mp4"></video>

1. **Create a new Google Sheet** named "successful calls" for example

2. **Set up column headers:**
   - **Column A**: `phone_number`
   - **Column B**: `summary` 
   - Add more columns for additional data as needed

## Step 9: Configure Spreadsheet Selection

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/19-select-target-spreadsheet.mp4"></video>

1. **Return to your automation**
2. **Select your "successful calls" spreadsheet**
3. **Select the correct sheet** (usually "Sheet1")

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/20-enable-headers.mp4"></video>

4. **Enable "First row contains headers"**:
   - This tells the automation about your column structure
   - Headers should automatically load and display

## Step 10: Map Call Data to Spreadsheet Columns

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/21-map-phone-number.mp4"></video>

1. **Map the phone number:**
   - Click on the `phone_number` field
   - **Select "Phone Call Ended"** data source
   - **Find and select the phone number** from call data
   - Click "Insert"

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/23-map-summary.mp4"></video>

2. **Map the call summary:**
   - Click on the `summary` field
   - **Navigate to "Post Call Variables"**
   - **Select the `summary` variable**
   - Click "Insert"

4. **Map any additional fields:**
   - Email from call variables
   - Call date/time from call metadata
   - Any custom variables you've defined

## Step 11: Test and Verify

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsinline
  src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/25-test-sheets-integration.mp4"></video>

1. **Click "Test Step"** to verify the integration
2. **Check for successful execution**
3. **Go to your Google Sheet** to confirm:
   - New row was added with correct data
   - All mapped fields populated properly
   - Data formatting looks correct

## Step 12: Publish and Monitor

<Frame>
  <img src="/resources/tutorials/qualified-leads/27-publish-automation.png" alt="Publishing the automation" />
</Frame>

1. **Click "Publish"** to activate your automation
2. **Your qualified leads tracking is now live**
3. **Monitor automation performance:**
   - Check automation "Runs" for execution history
   - Verify qualified leads are being added to your sheet
   - Monitor for any failed executions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Leads not appearing in spreadsheet:**
- Verify Google Sheets connection is authorized
- Check that automation is published and active
- Confirm calls are triggering `status` = `true`
- Verify branch condition is configured correctly

**Incomplete data in spreadsheet:**
- Check all field mappings in the automation
- Verify post-call variables are being extracted
